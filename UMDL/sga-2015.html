  Voting for the 2015 Student Government Association election takes place Monday and Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
  SGA is an organization that voices students' opinions and concerns to administration, faculty and the community, according to the Ball State website.
</p>
<p>
  In the 2014 elections, there were a total of 2,871 votes, a decrease from 2013, which saw 4,985 votes.
</p>
<p>
  This year, students have the chance to vote among three slates. Students will receive a link in their email to vote. Here is a breakdown of the possibility of their platform points and an introduction to the slates.

        <h2>SGA slates still face fines after appeal</h2><br><br><br><br>

          <center><h3>Raymond Garcia</h3><br><h5><i>The Daily News</i></h5></center>
 
<p>
  Student Government Association slates Atlas and Cardinal Direction will still be fined after appealing the original decision.
</p>
<p>
  The Student Judicial Court made the decision Friday, according to a press release.
</p>
<p>
  Atlas campaign manager Chloe Anagnos said the appeal was fair. 
</p>
<p>
  "I respect the board's decision, I figured that it would be a long shot," she said. 
</p>
<p>
  Cardinal Direction campaign manager D'Marcus Pulce said he hopes this does not become an issue for future slates running for office. 
</p>
<p>
  "I think it was as fair as it's going to be," he said. "We made the appeal hoping they would see where we are coming from." 
</p>
<p>
  Atlas and Cardinal Direction each violated Article 6, Section 2, Part D of the elections code which states, “Candidates may begin campaigning upon the close of the Nomination Convention and shall end upon the conclusion of the election.”
</p>
<p>
  Atlas’ Facebook profile and cover photos were posted before the end of the convention, according to WCRD.
</p>
<p>
  Cardinal Direction created their Facebook page in 2014 but there was no content until the convention, said Election Board Chair Zach Huffman.
</p>
<p>
  Chief Justice Spencer Bonahoom said Cardinal Direction argued their page did not go public until the nomination convention was over.
</p>
<p>
  He said Atlas argued there was a miscommunication with the campaign team and they did not intend to campaign early.
</p>
<p>
  “We took a substantial amount of time to review and research each violation,” Huffman said. “Hearing the Student Judicial Court agree with our decision validates our positions on these fines.”
</p>
<p>
  Both slates used up their one and only appeal to the court, according to the press release.

<p>
	The final debate of the Student Government Association executive slate election saw another attendance breaking record.
</p>
<p>
	 	Arts and Journalism Building Room 175 was filled with people in seats and some on the aisles. At the end of the debate, Elections Board Chair Zach Huffman told the audience that 245 people were in attendance at the presidential debate.
</p>
<p>
	 	“There is still one record that needs to be broken,” he said, “That is the largest amount of students being informed and voted on Monday and Tuesday.”
</p>
<p>
	 	The debate itself focused less on the platform points and more on the candidates themselves.
</p>
<p>
	 	Brianna Kirkham, the debate moderator, said this debate was more conversational than the previous two.
</p>
<p>
	 	“This was the first time we got to see them as humans,” she said. “Tonight you could see their personality shine.”
</p>
<p>
	 	One question from social media asked each candidate to express a weakness he has and how he plans to overcome it.
</p>
<p>
	 	Jack Hesser, from Atlas, said he is pragmatic and that his slate mates Austin Acel and Meagan Mullen have helped him think bigger.
</p>
<p>
	 	“They have helped me throughout this whole process to make sure we can accomplish so many amazing things for this campus,” he said.
</p>
<p>
	 	Jacob Cash, from Cardinal Direction, said he could be too passionate at times when it comes to his organizations and activities.
</p>
<p>
	 	“A lot of times I forgot myself, and I think in the sense of the organization,” he said. “But it really helps the organization out in the end."
</p>
<p>
	 	Quintin Thompson said he tries to immediately problem solve and handle issues as quickly as possible, which does not always work out.
</p>
<p>
	 	“This campaign in many ways has helped shape me to be able to slow down and think about different solutions,” he said.
</p>
<p>
	 	When it comes to strengths, Thompson said he is a good listener and referenced his duties as a resident assistant to exemplify that.
</p>
<p>
	 	“I am someone who listens to all perspectives and all sides, “ he said. “I think it is important to be a leader who listens and not just dictates what’s going to happen.”
</p>
<p>
	 	Hesser spoke about his previous accomplishments through SGA such as the University Police Department Lunch and his collaboration with his slate mate vice president Richu Aby.
</p>
<p>
	 	“The strength that I bring to the table is something that Richu and I share, which is our previous involvement within SGA, “ he said.
</p>
<p>
	 	Cash said he is a servant leader and he has set aside time to commit to this role.
</p>
<p>
	 	“My strength in this position would be the amount of time I have going forward to dedicate to this position," he said.
</p>
<p>
	 	Students will receive a link via email to vote Monday and Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
	 	Results will be announced Tuesday night.

  The three presidential candidates for the Student Government Association will face off against one another Thursday at the final debate of the election season.
</p>
<p>
      At the full slate debate Tuesday, 371 people were in attendance: a record-breaking number, according to a press release from the elections board.
</p>
<p>
      Slips of paper were given to the attendees to write down which slate they would vote for and why. According to the release, however, those results will not be released due to unfair distribution.
</p>
<p>
      Jennifer Jones-Hall said campaign managers had grabbed more than one slip each when voting.
</p>
<p>
      "Ethics are so important to us in these elections," Jones-Hall said. "Let's remember that as we proceed through the election."
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The Presidential Candidates </strong>
</p>
<p>
      Jacob Cash, president from Cardinal Direction said his peers describe him as a servant leader who leads by example.
</p>
<p>
      "A true leader builds credibility and accountability through leading by example and never wavering in their word," he said "This is the type of leader that I strive to be on a daily basis."
</p>
<p>
      He said SGA has given him the opportunity to implement change for Ball State students.
</p>
<p>
      "One of the most rewarding components of being in SGA is to see the positive impact that it continually has on campus," he said.
</p>
<p>
      Jack Hesser, president of Atlas, said the most rewarding parts of SGA are the small victories senators fight for that do not become major campus issues.
</p>
<p>
      "When you leave a meeting with an administrator and develop a new solution to an old problem, and the administrators decide to implement the changes regardless of legislation or countless readings in senate," he said, "That's when you know you are doing your job and making this campus better."
</p>
<p>
      Hesser said the most important aspects of leadership include communication, motivation and passion.
</p>
<p>
      "What truly makes a successful leader, in my mind, is their ability to motivate and encourage those he or she leads," Hesser said.
</p>
<p>
      Quintin Thompson, president of Momentum, said SGA has allowed him to meet many different people from campus. and it has been rewarding making positive changes on campus.
</p>
<p>
      He said his leadership style is based on listening, problem-solving and building a consensus.
</p>
<p>
      "I see an issue and I go straight for it. I don't dance around the issue," he said.  "I want to make plans that are equitable for everyone, even though building consensus is often difficult."

  David Letterman Communication and Media Building Room 125 was nearly full as students came out Thursday night to support the three slates running for the Student Government Association executive office.
</p>
<p>
  Current Vice President Bryan Kubel said this debate has not usually gotten that much attention in previous years.
</p>
<p>
  "It only shows that students are interested in SGA elections this year, and it makes me happy as a current officer," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Thursday's vice presidential candidate debate was the first of three for this election season.
</p>
<p>
  Junior journalism and telecommunications major Bri Kirkham will serve as the moderator for all the debates this season.
</p>
<p>
  She said students were engaged and had specific questions to ask.
</p>
<p>
  "They are trying to get involved with this university, and that's what matters," she said.
</p>
<p>
  The three vice presidential candidates each explained the platform points they have spearheaded.
</p>
<p>
  Wesley Crouch from Cardinal Direction discussed the point of Cardinal Fit. He said this program would feature custom workout and nutrition plans with collaboration from the Exercise Science Club.
</p>
<p>
  He said he wants to help students struggling to stay fit.
</p>
<p>
  According to Crouch's bio on Cardinal Direction's website, physical health is a major priority in his life.
</p>
<p>
  Momentum's Bonu Dustova spoke about implementing an international buddy system. She said this would involve matching a domestic student with an international student so they could learn about each other's culture. This would also help international students get more involved.
</p>
<p>
  Dustova herself is an international student from Tajikistan.
</p>
<p>
  Richu Aby from Atlas said she was heavily involved with the pothole of the month point. She said she has been working with Muncie Mayor Dennis Tyler recently on how to improve this.
</p>
<p>
  Atlas hopes to set up a social media system for students to submit pictures of potholes around Ball State.
</p>
<p>
  This point was later challenged when an audience member asked how this system would be different than the one the city of Muncie already has in place for people to submit a pothole repair.
</p>
<p>
  Aby said it would be more of a collaboration with the city to fix the ones near Ball State to benefit students.
</p>
<p>
  Another point of Atlas was challenged when an audience member asked about the implementation of later dining hours and its effects on students' unhealthy eating habits.
</p>
<p>
  Aby said she has worked with Jon Lewis, the director of campus dining services, and that healthy eating is a top priority for Lewis.
</p>
<p>
  Current President Nick Wilkey asked which slate the candidates viewed as the biggest competition.
</p>
<p>
  Dustova's response to that question generated the most buzz from the audience when she said she had no competitors in this election. Once the audience settled, she further explained what she meant.
</p>
<p>
  "We all strive to make things better," she said, "Every point of theirs could improve Ball State as much as ours would."
</p>

        <h2>SGA slates discuss potholes, platform points in all slate debate</h2></center>
      <div class="main">
        <br><br><center><h3>Raymond Garcia</h3><br><h5><i>The Daily News</i></h5></center>
<p>
  During the Student Government Association's full slate debate Tuesday night,  Atlas's point of Pothole of the Month was challenged the most by the other slates, Momentum and Cardinal Direction.
</p>
<p>
    Atlas was asked to explain if they had fixed any potholes yet and what they anticipate to be their biggest challenge.
</p>
<p>
    Richu Aby, vice president candidate for Atlas, said the slate has chosen a pothole on Martin St. For the campaign, students have the opportunity to submit their own photos of potholes to be filled. She said they plan to fill the Martin St. pothole before campaigning is over.
</p>
<p>
    "With this pothole platform, it sounds like you are taking credit for something the city of Muncie is actually doing," said presidential candidate for Momentum, Quintin Thompson.
</p>
<p>
    Aby responded,  "In no way we are taking credit from the city of Muncie, we partnered with the city of Muncie. I truly do admire the leadership and the compassion they have for this city."
</p>
<p>
    Jacob Cash, president from Cardinal Direction, said current vice president Bryan Kubel tweeted @MunciePotholes and the pothole submitted was fixed within 48 hours.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm just curious as to why this initiative is different, it seems like it is taking more time than the system that is already set up?" he said.
</p>
<p>
    President of Atlas, Jack Hesser, said the goal of the platform point is to ensure the minimum one a month on Ball State's campus.
</p>
<p>
    Cardinal Direction's Dead Week point also drew discussion. Dead Week is when there is no homework or projects the week before finals to give students more time to study.
</p>
<p>
    Brianna Kirkham, a junior journalism major and moderator of the debate, asked the slate if they thought there was enough student interest and what they would do differently. The idea was attempted by the university governance a decade ago.
</p>
<p>
    "Everywhere we have visited so far talking about Dead Week, this is the one thing students can't stop talking about," Cash said.
</p>
<p>
    He said the slate will build a campaign for Dead Week to make sure everyone knows it's happening.
</p>
<p>
    Hesser said he had spoken to Associate Provost and Dean of University College Marilyn Buck. She expressed concern with how to make Dead Week possible. Legislation would have needed to be passed in January.
</p>
<p>
    "I was just wondering how you guys can process a Dead Week this fall?" Hesser said.
</p>
<p>
    "We never said we would get it done by next fall, we said we want to make it happen," Cash said.
</p>
<p>
    He said it might not be accomplished during their term but it would be approved and implemented the following semesters.
</p>
<p>
    Each slate discussed which platform point they will work on first if they are elected Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
    Hesser said they would like to continue Pothole of the Month and start Lunch on Board where students can have a free meal with the executive board and discuss ideas and concerns.
</p>
<p>
    Dayna Arnett, treasurer from Momentum, said they would like to implement the International Buddy System point.
</p>
<p>
    She said they want students to feel like Ball State is a home away from home. They would also like to start the Bystander Intervention point to help students become more aware of sexual assault.
</p>
<p>
    Wesley Crouch, vice president from Cardinal Direction, said they want to start on the Brighter Muncie campaign to install more streetlights around Ball State's campus. He said their main concern is student safety.
</p>
<p>
    During each of the slates closing statements, Thompson's statement drew a large crowd reaction.
</p>
<p>
    "If you want no change to occur within our student government then vote for the two other slates, but if you are ready for students to serve students then vote for Momentum. "
