<h2 style="color:black;">Ball State sexual assault numbers double even with under reporting</h2><br>

						<p><!--<span class="first-character atw">I</span>-->If a person commits sexual assault on Ball State’s campus, they are not likely to ever sit behind bars.
						</p>
						<p>
							That’s because when the university&mdash;any university&mdash;investigates a sexual assault, it is considered a policy violation and not a criminal matter as it would be if reported to a law enforcement agency.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even when someone reports sexual assault only to the university, the most common punishment is a suspension, according to documents obtained in an email through Joan Todd, university spokesperson.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 2013, the number of sexual assaults reported to Ball State almost doubled from the previous year, according to figures that&nbsp;the university is required to report to the U.S. Department of Education. Ball State has the second highest sexual assault numbers out of the 12 universities in the MAC, behind Miami University, with 18 total reported cases in 2013. Title IX Coordinator for Student Affairs Katie Slabaugh attributes this increased number to improved reporting.
						</p>
						<p>
							But this number is only a fraction of the actual sexual assaults that occur on campus each year. An estimated 68 percent of sexual assaults go unreported, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, and the perpetrators never receive any kind of punishment.
						</p>

						<p>
							A U.S. Department of Justice study said the top reason people don’t report sexual assaults is because it is a personal matter that others didn’t report because of a fear of reprisal, because they didn’t think it was important enough or because they didn’t think the police could do anything about it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Compared to all other age groups, college-aged women are four times more likely to be sexually assaulted, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.
						</p>
                                                <center><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.bsd/18209_processonline01f.jpg" class="sidepic"></center>
						<p>
							Allison Wynbissinger, Ball State’s victim advocate, said many students don’t report because they don’t consider what happened to them to be rape. She said many think of the stereotype that rapes are committed by strangers in the middle of the night.
						</p>
						<p>
							“So when some of our students have gone out and they’re drinking with people they know, and this person that they know, trust, they’ve hung out with before walks them back into their room and ends up having sex with them when they pass out or against their will, but doesn’t necessarily use physical force or hold them down, maybe in their mind they’re like, ‘OK, well, this is what I’ve always heard is sexual assault and what happened to me doesn’t fit in that box,’” Wynbissinger said.
						</p>
						
                                                    <p>
                        							<strong>Clery reports</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							One reason for low reported numbers is how the university defines what is on campus and what isn’t.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ball State must report all sex offenses to the federal government because of the Clery Act, which requires public universities to keep track of and disclose crime statistics on and around campus each year.
						</p>
						<p>
							The U.S. Department of Education decides what is considered to be on campus. Those boundaries don’t include the approximate 60 percent of students who live off campus at Ball State, according to documents in an email from Todd. In fact, the boundaries for Clery end beyond the sidewalks that border campus.
						</p>
						<p>
							Mike Gillilan, director of student rights and community standards, said the DOE doesn’t want universities to go outside of the decided boundaries because it makes it too difficult to compare schools.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Handling cases</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Three agencies in Muncie investigate charges of sexual abuse:
						</p>
						<ul style="margin-left:30px;">
							<li>Muncie Police Department</li>
							<li>University Police Department</li>
							<li>The university itself</li>
						</ul><br>
						<p>
							While there is less burden of proof in a case reported to the university&mdash;it needs be “more likely than not” to have occurred&mdash;the penalties are also less severe. A person found guilty would be in violation of school policy, and the penalty could be as light as a school suspension or disciplinary probation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Universities handle sexual assaults to give survivors of sexual assault another option to report to. Reporting to the university involves a shorter process, Slabaugh said.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ball State has reported 38 sexual assault cases in the Clery reports since 2012. Of those, 28 were either reported to both the university and the University Police Department, or solely to UPD, according to documents obtained in an email from Todd. The remaining 10 were only reported to the university.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since August 2012, the university has investigated 49 cases of sexual assault, including 11 that were not reported for Clery Act purposes, according to documents obtained in an email from Todd. Of those, only nine ended with any kind of punishment, most of which were school suspensions. The other 40 cases investigated had insufficient information for the case to proceed.
						</p>
						<p>
							The university would not release the names of the students found responsible for sexual misconduct policy violations because the names are not compiled by category of offense, and it could lead to the identification of the victims, whose identity is protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), according to the Office of University Compliance.
						</p>
						<p>
							Slabaugh said faculty, staff and administration care about students’ well-being on campus, which is why the university should be able to handle these cases.
						</p>
						<p>
							“My feeling &hellip; would be, even if we were not required to do so, universities have historically had structures in place [to help victims],” Slabaugh said. “All of those things are aiming toward a healthy, positive experience for students.”
						</p>
						<p>
							However, a British research psychologist who specializes in the psychology of sexual abuse said to her, the idea that universities can handle something as serious as sexual assault cases is “insane.”
						</p>
						<p>
							“If someone was murdered on campus, would they also take over the criminal justice part of that, or would the police be like, ‘Oh no no, that’s us?’” Nina Burrowes said. “Because sexual assault and murder, they both go under the category of serious crime.”
						</p>
						<p>
							In the United Kingdom, all reported sexual assault cases are investigated by the police, she said.
						</p>
						<p>
							Burrowes said the fact that the U.S. is having so many problems with universities not doing a good job dealing with sexual assault cases is evidence that this isn’t the way to do it.
						</p>
						<p>
							“Someone cheats on an exam, great, fine, perfect,” she said. “But rape? That’s just insane. I wonder if colleges have thought of the impact they’re having on the offenders. It’s having an impact on them too, along the lines of, ‘That is OK, carry on as you are, it’s not really important.’"

                <h2 style="color:black;">Students live with trauma after sexual assault</h2><br><br>
					<p>
						*</em><i style="background-color: initial;">The names of the students have been changed to protect their identity.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						Hannah Pike* has been raped twice. Once by a friend she had been sleeping with for about a month, and the second by a man she met online.
					</p>
					<p>
						Pike is among the one-in-five women who have been raped, according to a 2012 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
					</p>
					<p>
						But the assault is only the beginning of the trauma that victims experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The assaults</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Before the first sexual assault, Pike had told her friend she didn’t have the romantic feelings for him that he had for her, and didn’t want to sleep with him anymore.
					</p>
					<p>
						They were at a bar in downtown Muncie, and while they were walking home, he started acting aggressively and tried to kiss Pike, even when she repeatedly said she was tired and wanted to go home.
					</p>
					<p>
						“It was all really confusing because at that point &hellip; I still had that image of rape being the thing that happens in alleyways and the guy with the knife and not with this person you really trust who is your friend,” Pike said. “So at that point, I still hadn’t thought ‘I’m scared.’ I didn’t think he would hurt me. I just thought, ‘This is annoying and I kind of want to go home.’”
					</p>
					<p>
						When they got back to his house, he kept trying to get Pike to come inside. She was trying to find a way to not go in, but she kept thinking about how she had to go to the bathroom.
					</p>
					<p>
						“And of course he was like, ‘You can use the bathroom in my place,’” she said. “At that point I didn’t know how to get out of it.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Once she got in the bathroom, Pike was scared to leave. She didn’t know how she was going to get out when she left the bathroom. When she left, he raped her.
					</p>
					<p>
						“It’s still really scary for me because there was so much coercion instead of threats of physical force, which is what we tend to think of rape as,” Pike said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Allison Wynbissinger, Ball State’s victim advocate, said the media has perpetuated the idea that the man in the bushes is going to be the rapist. Two thirds of the time, the victim knows the rapist, according to Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.
					</p>
					<p>
						Pike didn’t even think she was raped until a friend told her it sounded like rape, and asked her if she was okay.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Then I was just crying and crying,” Pike said.
					</p>
					<p>
						She never pressed charges&mdash;she didn’t want to ruin his life.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I kept thinking that’s what would happen and I didn’t want to do that,” Pike said. “There’s this weird thing, there’s this urge where you sympathize with your attacker and you don’t want to hurt them, even though they’ve done this horrible thing to you.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Pike said she had an immense support system of family and friends, but she did have a few friends who reacted badly when she told them. One friend asked her if she was sure it was rape, because she had slept with a lot of men in the past.
					</p>
					<p>
						“She didn’t say, ‘Because you’re kind of a slut,’ but that was definitely the meaning in there,” Pike said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another friend accused her of lying to get attention because she was telling people what had happened, and because that isn’t the normal response for sexual assault survivors, he assumed she wasn’t telling the truth.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nina Burrowes, a British research psychologist who specializes in the psychology of sexual abuse, said when friends are disbelieving, it can actually end up being worse than the sexual assault.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Because you’re violated by your abuser and then your community&nbsp;&hellip; they also let you down by not believing you,” Burrowes said. “That can make it feel worse.”
					</p>
					<p>
						On the other hand, she said having a strong support system can let survivors know they are loved and safe, and ready to be listened to and believed.
					</p>
					<p>
						“[Sexual assault] can make you feel like you’re invalid, like what you want and what you want right now doesn’t count, it’s all about what I want as the abuser,” Burrowes said. “So it’s really important that you hang around with people who make you feel valid again, like you’re a person, and again that you feel safe, because of course that can be very difficult after abuse, especially if you’re still living a trauma.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Pike said in some ways, the first rape led to the second.
					</p>
					<p>
						“After I was raped the first time, I kept thinking about how you hear a lot about rape victims not being able to have sex after that,” she said. “That freaked me out because I was a very sexual person, and I don’t want that to happen to me.”
					</p>
					<p>
						The second time, Pike was raped by a man she met online.
					</p>
					<p>
						When she first met up with him, she said there were some red flags that she had ignored. He was aggressive and pushed her limits a little further than she liked, but she never thought of it as assault.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Now looking back, it most definitely was, because he was definitely manipulating me and pushing me way farther than I wanted to go,” Pike said.
					</p>
					<p>
						When they were having sex, she said it got to a point where the pain was more than she liked.
					</p>
					<p>
						But Pike said she was in “such a weird emotional place” that she just went with it.
					</p>
					<p>
						They didn’t talk again for a while, but Pike called him again a few months later.
					</p>
					<p>
						The sex started off consensual, but when he wanted to have anal sex and Pike did not, she told him to stop. He kept going.
					</p>

					<p>
						“Even though I said no, he just kept going and I cried, and I said, ‘You know I was raped, you can’t do this,’” she said. “In my head I was still thinking, ‘Is this rape too? I don’t know.’ Both times it happened, in the moment there was so much shock with what was going on. Again it was someone I kind of trusted, even though there had been those red flags. I convinced myself he was fine.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Afterwards, he held Pike and let her cry, and told her he was sorry. He asked her if she was going to call the cops, and then laughed. He proceeded to rape her again.
					</p>
					<p>
						“That’s the thing I remember the most, him making a joke and laughing about it,” Pike said. “Then he took me home. The entire time he was taking me home he was telling me this story about his fiancée who got a restraining order against him, but it didn’t do anything, he still went to her house. And he was telling it like a story, but &hellip; it felt like a warning.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Pike said he was stronger than she was.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I got the sense that the entire time, he would hurt me worse if I fought,” Pike said. “I was terrified, so I went with it.”
					</p>
					<p>
						This time, Pike went to the hospital to get a rape kit done and filed a police report. She said with the first man, she didn’t want to ruin his life, but she also didn’t think he would rape anyone else.
					</p>
					<p>
						But with the second, she thought he was scary and cold, that she wouldn’t be surprised if he had already raped someone else.
					</p>
					<p>
						Pike said she had heard horror stories about how rape victims are usually treated by the police, but the Muncie Police Department officers she talked to were understanding and nice.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, filing a police report didn’t do anything. Pike said the&nbsp;Muncie&nbsp;Police&nbsp;Department interviewed him and their stories matched, up until the part where she said no. He said she never said no. So the case was never prosecuted because there wasn’t enough evidence, according to Sergeant Seth Stanley, who leads the criminal investigations department.
					</p>
					<p>
						“One of the things that still really messes me up to this day is that the reason he probably got away with it is because he didn’t hurt me enough,” Pike said. “There were a couple of bruises and bite marks, but that was from when it was consensual, and a little bit of tearing, but not that much. It was my word against his.”
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>The recovery</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Pike has been able to talk openly about both of her assaults since they happened.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I’ve had a lot of my friends, and even people I don’t know, come to me after I’ve tweeted about it or written or blogged about it and said, ‘The fact that you’ve been able to talk about it has meant so much to me and makes me feel like I can talk about [their own assaults],’” Pike said. “Getting those reactions makes me feel like I want to be as open as possible.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Finding out some of her friends have also been assaulted helped Pike realize she wasn’t alone.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the first year, Pike said she felt numb, like she wasn’t processing what had happened.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I was angry and upset and blaming myself, but I could still function,” she said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Burrowes said sexual assault is “a crime against the self.” She said while the physical injuries are traumatic, the psychological injuries are worse.
					</p>
                                        <p class="pq" style="font-size:30px;line-height:30px;">
                                                “I think our ability to make choices is the core of who you are, and if you can’t even choose who touches you intimately at what time and how, what choices can you make? I think this is why it can be so impactful,” she said.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="pq2">
                                                “I think our ability to make choices is the core of who you are, and if you can’t even choose who touches you intimately at what time and how, what choices can you make? I think this is why it can be so impactful,” she said.
                                        </p>
					<p>
						Last year when Pike first moved off campus and had to rely on taking the bus, it hit her hard.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I’m surrounded by all these men I don’t know,” Pike said. “I’ve had guys come up to me on the bus and be harassing me.”
					</p>
					<p>
						She also had trouble being in class with male students.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because one in 12 male college students has attempted rape, according to the National College Health Risk Behavior Survey, Pike said all she could think about in class was how many of those men were part of that 8 percent.
					</p>
					<p>
						Pike dropped down to one class in the fall semester following the second rape, and two in the spring semester.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I just became a massive recluse because I was so scared about being out in the world with men,” Pike said. “Now it’s getting back to better again. Sometimes it’s still really hard. But I know I have a solid friend group now where I know if anything ever happened, they would protect me.”
					</p>
					<p>
						But even though it’s gotten easier, Pike said she doesn’t know if she’ll ever get closure.
					</p>
					<p>
						“In some ways I wonder if I’ve gotten the most I’ll ever get, just because I’m able to write about it, talk about it freely, but I feel like there’s always going to be that anger and frustration that nothing happened to them,” Pike said.
					</p>
					<p>
						She said a month after the first rape, she had been posting about it on her private Tumblr blog and the man contacted her. He told her to stop talking about it.
					</p>
					<p>
						He said it was making him feel bad, and that he had talked to his friends and they said it wasn’t rape. He said he had forgiven himself, so she should, too.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I wish there was something I could do to make it so they could never forget, the way I have never been able to forget what they did,” Pike said.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Men and assault</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Although statistically men are sexually assaulted less often than women are, they are also even less likely to report it for fear of not being believed, according to Michael Scarce, the author of Male on Male Rape: The Hidden Toll of Stigma and Shame.
					</p>
					<p>
						One in 71 men have been raped at some point in their lives, according to the CDC study.
					</p>
					<p>
						And one in 20 women and men reported experiencing some kind of sexual violence other than rape in the year prior. Sexual violence is committing sexual acts without the consent of the other person.
					</p>
					<p>
						When Evan Taylor* was sexually assaulted his freshman year at Ball State, he chose not to report it to anyone.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I thought no one would ever believe that I had been sexually assaulted,” Taylor said. “As a freshman, that was my state of mind, that I’m a male and no one’s going to believe me.”
					</p>
					<p>
						One of his friends from class had reached out to him on Facebook and asked if he wanted to hang out.
					</p>
					<p>
						They had hung out a few times in groups, but one weekend he went to Taylor’s to watch a movie.
					</p>
					<p>
						As they were watching, the man made a move on him.
					</p>
					<p>
						“In and of itself, making a move wasn’t that big of a deal,” Taylor said. “I was like ‘Hey, I’m sorry, no,’ and I thought that would be it.”
					</p>
					<p>
						And nothing else happened that night. Taylor said he was glad the man respected boundaries.
					</p>
					<p>
						But two weeks later, the man asked Taylor if he wanted to study for an upcoming test. Their plan was to meet at a campus building, but when Taylor got there, he saw the man standing outside the doors. He said they were locked, and asked Taylor if he just wanted to go to his place to study.
					</p>
					<p>
						As they were walking back, the man tried to make a move on him again, and Taylor pushed him off.
					</p>
					<p>
						“He forcefully tried to kiss me, and I really did try [to make him stop], like, I didn’t want it to happen,” Taylor said. “... I just was not interested in anything with males, period. So it made it that much more hard for me, because there was no way, shape or form I wanted this to be happening.”
					</p>
					<p>
						The man was aggressively kissing and grabbing Taylor, and as much as he tried, he couldn’t get away. At one point, he pushed Taylor up against the fence that was behind them.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Eventually, I did get out of the situation,” Taylor said. “I don’t want to say he was understanding&mdash;because he absolutely was not&mdash;but I think it came to a point where it wasn’t fun for him anymore and when it stopped being fun for him and started being more work.”
					</p>
					<p>
						When the man finally left, Taylor said he was a “complete trainwreck.”
					</p>
					<p>
						He immediately called his big brother in his fraternity, and he was there within a few minutes.

						“It’s really odd to be a male involved in sexual assault when you’re the victim, because you don’t really know what your options actually are,” Taylor said.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the time, he didn’t want to report it, even though one of his friends encouraged him to. His friend told him he needed to tell in case the man tried to sexually assault someone else.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Reporting everything would have made it seem so much more real, and I didn’t want to give it that validity,” Taylor said. “... I thought that somehow if I didn’t report it, it wouldn’t be real.”
					</p>
					<p>
						One of his friends who lived with him in the residence halls told him about all the campus resources available for him to use, but he chose not to take advantage of any of them.
					</p>
					<p>
						“As a freshman, even though the resources were still there, I don’t think it was talked about as much, and so because of that it made me feel more uncomfortable,” he said. “I really regret that. That was stupid of me, but I was really fortunate enough to have a really great support system within my fraternity. Those guys were there for me.”
					</p>
					<p>
						However, he said for some of his brothers, there was a fleeting moment when he first told them what happened when they hesitated, and he could tell they were questioning what he said.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Not to say they don’t believe you, but [sexual assault against males] is not something that’s talked about,” Taylor said. “There’s that moment where they look at you and you can tell they’re thinking, ‘Wait, like really?’ But my friends didn’t dwell on that for too long.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Taylor said while he had the support of his fraternity brothers, many freshmen don’t have strong support systems when they first come to campus.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I have no idea what you would do if you were in a situation in which you were sexually assaulted and you didn’t have a support group,” he said. “... If that were to happen, it could really ruin not just your collegiate experience, but your state of mind.”
					</p>
					<p>
						He said this is why programs that&nbsp;the university offers are so, especially during the Red Zone - the first six weeks of school when sexual assaults are most likely to occur on college campuses - are so important. At Ball State, those preventive programs include Step In. Speak Up. and the University Police Department’s Rape Aggression Defense system.
					</p>
					<p>
						Taylor didn’t tell his family about the sexual assault until last summer, and he said they were understanding and supportive.
					</p>
					<p>
						He said he only told some of his fraternity brothers and close friends because he was embarrassed.
					</p>

                                                “Sexual assault is almost always portrayed as a man against a woman, so I think a lot of times a man assaulting a man or a woman assaulting a woman or a woman assaulting a man is just so often not seen,” Taylor said. “Even if you look at case studies, it’s not something we talk about a lot. It made me feel even more uncomfortable because it was like, this isn’t normal, this is so odd.”
                                        </p>

					<p>
						Burrowes said shame and guilt are probably the biggest reasons people don’t report, and combined with those two, the fear that they won’t be believed.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the assault, Taylor said he was a bit more apprehensive of people at first. He was hesitant to hang out with people he didn’t know that well one-on-one, which hindered his ability to build those connections.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I’m a very outgoing person, I’m very extroverted, so I love getting to know new people,” Taylor said. “But when it came to one-on-one hanging out, it’s something,&nbsp;even now, that I still hesitate with. But I’m working on it and feeling better. It’s just something that’s continued to evolve since freshman year.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Now that the man who assaulted him has graduated and is not on campus anymore, Taylor said it was easier to move on.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Even though he wasn’t in my life, knowing that he was not at my university really helped to make me feel better,” he said.&nbsp;

						<p>
							Hearing about a friend’s sexual assault is never an easy situation to be in. For a resident assistant, it’s something they prepare for before beginning the job.
						</p>
						<p>
							Brooke Sturgell, a senior visual communications major and a former RA, handled it with a clear head when a resident brought up an assault that had happened in the past.
						</p>
						<p>
							“She was referencing it in a way where she was detached from it, but still wanted to talk about it. It still made her feel kind of uncomfortable,” Sturgell said. “Obviously it was traumatic for her at some point, but it was more the grieving process for her and her trying to heal herself over time.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Sturgell said the resident had told all of her RAs in the past about it, because it sometimes could affect her mood, so if she acted in a certain way, she wanted Sturgell to know why.
						</p>
                                        <div class="leftmarge">
                                                At the university level, there are multiple ways a sexual assault can be reported. Some sources are confidential, but others must report any sexual assaults to the university.
                                                <br><br>
                                                If any staff at the university hears about or is told about a sexual assault, they must report it to either Katie Slabaugh, Title IX Coordinator for Student Affairs, or John Bowers, Director of Institutional Equity Internal Investigations. That includes office staff, faculty, university police department, residence hall staff and coaches.
                                                <br><br>
                                                However, there are also university sources who are confidential, and cannot report sexual assaults to the university. That includes the Office of Victim Services, the Health Center, the Counseling Center and Allison Wynbissinger, the victim advocate, as well as many off-campus resources like A Better Way. Because the Counseling Center and the Health Center are medical centers, they are bound under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Wynbissinger and the Office of Victim Services are a confidential source available to students.
                                        </div>
						<p>
							“That was her way of coping with it,” Sturgell said.
						</p>
						<p>
							When an RA, or any university staff, is told about a sexual assault, they must report it to the university, specifically&nbsp;either Katie Slabaugh, Title IX Coordinator for Student Affairs, or John Bowers, Director of Institutional Equity Internal Investigations.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sturgell said she had always had the ability to empathize with people, and that helped her in this situation, and with being a good RA in general.
						</p>
						<p>
							“It’s easy for me to look at someone else’s situation and not belittle it,” Sturgell said.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sturgell didn’t feel uncomfortable talking to her resident about this sensitive topic, because RAs receive training before the year starts.
						</p>
						<p>
							Matt Kovach, Assistant Director of Housing and Residence Life, said in the summer they have a training session called Behind Closed Doors. The RAs go through scenarios where they are confronted with a problem, and they have to deal with it in a real-life manner.
						</p>
						<p>
							“Returning staff members role-play scenarios where a new RA will have to come in and confront and have those conversations so they have the opportunity to practice with their peers and get some advice,” Kovach said. “Even for someone who’s done it before, that’s a hard conversation and the reality is, that person might not be ready to have it, and that’s okay.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Kovach said they try to make the RAs understand that they aren’t counselors, and that it isn’t their job to sit there with them and process the whole situation with their resident if they don’t feel able to.
						</p>
						<p>
							He said their main goal is to direct them to people who would be able to help them.
						</p>
						<p>
							Brogan Drumm, a senior theatre major and a former RA, said they had cards to give to residents with numbers they could call to get help. She never had to deal with a resident who had been sexually assaulted. However, she said if the situation had come up, she felt prepared to deal with it, but not emotionally ready for it.
						</p>
						<p>
							“I don’t think anyone feels prepared or ready to handle a situation like that, regardless of how much training you’ve had. If a resident, especially your resident, or a friend comes up to you and confides in you that they have been sexually assaulted, I don’t think anyone is really ready to deal with that or help them handle that,” Drumm said.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sturgell said when a problem comes up, the best thing a RA can do for their resident is listen.
						</p>
						<p>
							Often, she said problems came up when RAs didn’t listen to their residents, or they didn’t take the time to sit and talk with them.
						</p>
						<p>
							“Most people don’t listen to listen, they listen to wait for their turn to talk,” Sturgell said. “I feel like the most innovative thing I did was sit and listen to people. That was always beneficial for them because they knew they could always come and talk to me whenever they wanted, so it created a safe space between me and them.”

                        <h2 style="color:black;padding:0px;">Effectiveness of new sexual assault prevention program hard to measure</h2><Br><Br>
					<p>
						Starting in August 2014, Ball State implemented an online education program for all incoming freshmen and transfer students called Think About It.
					</p>
					<p>
						Of the incoming freshmen in 2014, 86.7 percent completed the program, which Tom Gibson, associate vice president for student affairs, said was a good completion rate.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to encourage students to finish the course, students receive weekly emails reminding them to take it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The program was implemented because a new legislation that updates the Clery Act, the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, requires public universities to provide education and programming to students and employees about domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the first year, Gibson said he thought the program had been a positive experience overall, according to student feedback.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I think the fact that the course allows students to provide feedback on their experience taking the course was very helpful and reaffirming for us,” Gibson said. “By and large the majority of the students who completed the course said, ‘I didn’t know what to expect, I didn’t think I would find this useful, but you know what? It actually was. So thank you.’ We knew this was the right thing to do, but we didn’t know how well it would be received.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Katie Slabaugh, Title IX coordinator for student affairs, said because of the way the program is designed, students aren’t able to just turn it on and walk away; they actually have to be engaged in it.
					</p>
					<p>
						“The impact of this is that you know more than 85 percent of your new students have completed the course, whereas something that this residence hall may offer to this group of students is not necessarily the equivalent,” Slabaugh said. “This has the benefit of one unified piece of the student union.”
					</p>
					<p>
						However, Gibson said measuring the actual effectiveness of the program isn’t practical after only a year of the program. He would like to have at least three years of data before measuring the effectiveness.
					</p>
					<p>
						“There are some initial things we can do, but we can’t really suggest there’s a relationship or a causal relationship,” Gibson said. “It’s very difficult to say it’s because of this course [that’s] why we are experiencing these outcomes.”
					</p>
					<p>
						There also isn’t much research on what an effective sexual violence prevention program needs to consist of.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sarah Van Orman, president of the American College Health Association, said longer programs tend to be more effective, and the longer the exposure, the better.
					</p>
					<p>
						She also stressed having multiple “doses” of education programs.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Some of what we know works, is that in general, one-session brief educational programs, those generally are not effective,” she said. “They can be helpful if combined with lots of other things, but by themselves those are not effective.”
					</p>
					<p>
						There are nine effective keys to prevention, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, including being comprehensive, having sufficient dose and duration, being socio-culturally relevant and using appropriate teaching methods.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Think About It course has two segments incoming students have to take – one in August before the students come to the university and one during Spring Semester.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the&nbsp;University of San Francisco, which co-created the Think About It program with Campus Clarity, students are charged a $100 fine for each of the three parts of the program they don’t do. This also puts a hold on their accounts so they aren’t able to register for classes.
					</p>
					<p>
						“University of San Francisco is currently working on a Talk About It and a Do Something About It campaign, just trying to create more awareness and get student involvement in things like bystander intervention and really trying to create life-long awareness and involvement in causes like this,” said Deeqa Mohamed, a student peer educator at University of San Francisco.
					</p>
					<p>
						They had a 92 percent program completion rate for the 2014-15 school year, and have had the program for three years, Mohamed said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Other universities who have the program are University of Texas, University of Idaho and University of Cincinnati.
					</p>
					<p>
						University of Texas doesn’t allow students who haven’t completed the program to view their grades. University of Idaho and University of Cincinnati both use incentives and drawings to motivate students to complete the program.
					</p>
					<p>
						While Ball State doesn’t have incentives to finish the program,  throughout the school year the university offers other programs to help educate students, such as Red Zone, Step In. Speak Up., the University Police Department’s Rape Aggression Defense System class, Green Dot and other&nbsp;programs offered through Housing and Residence Life.
					</p>
					<p>
						Slabaugh said each residence hall is required to offer one prevention program per semester.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having those extra programs paired with the Think About It course would make the university’s overall education system more effective, Van Orman said, since students are repeatedly exposed to the information.
					</p>
					<p>
						Slabaugh said universities will always want to be able to have more sexual assault prevention programs. She said she wants to focus more on student engagement and getting students involved.
					</p>
					<p>
						“This is the student body and his or her campus and so what culture are they building?” Slabaugh said. “Each fall is three or four thousand [new] people, so it’s a constant turnover. There are new students to always be bringing into awareness and upper-class students being influential on them.”
					</p>
					<p>
						After going through the course, students were able to leave comments on what they thought of it. Gibson said there were 606 comments.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some comments said the course was too long, or that the course was all common-sense information, but overall, Gibson said the comments were positive.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Great way to go about this topic,” one of the comments read. “Hated it at first, but all-in-all, it wasn't so bad.”
					</p>
